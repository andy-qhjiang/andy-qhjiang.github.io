- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Qinghai Jiang (Alias: Andy Lincoln)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a Ph.D candidate in Mathematics and my focus is to utilize mathematical tools like optimization to help quantify aspects of the underlying principles behind art forms, like Kirigami (the art of cutting paper). You can find me in my supervisor's reseach group https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~ptchoi/group.html
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in various sports, ranging from hiking and swimming to playing badminton. I'm also a big fan of gorgeous beaches and majestic mountaions!
- ðŸ“« You can reach out to me by email: lingjun100010101 AT gmail DOT com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: When searching my name "Qinghai" in Google Scholar, you may come across many articles (about "me" but not mine) related to ecological topics. This is due to the unique nature of my first name, which shares its name with the largest lake in China and the province it is located in.
