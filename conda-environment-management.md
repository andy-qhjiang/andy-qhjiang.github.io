## 1. Difference between `pip install numpy` and `conda install -c conda-forge numpy`

**Question:** What is the difference between `pip install numpy` and `conda install -c conda-forge numpy` within a Conda environment?

**Answer:**

*   `conda install`: Uses the `conda` package manager, installs from Conda channels (like `conda-forge`), resolves dependencies considering both Python and non-Python packages, and installs pre-compiled binaries when available.

*   `pip install`: Uses the `pip` package manager, installs from PyPI, resolves Python dependencies, and may install from source if a wheel isn't available.

**Key Differences:**

| Feature             | `conda install -c conda-forge numpy`           | `pip install numpy`                    |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| Package Manager     | `conda`                                        | `pip`                                  |
| Source              | Conda channels (`conda-forge`, `defaults` etc.) | PyPI                                   |
| Dependency Scope    | Conda ecosystem (Python + non-Python)          | PyPI (primarily Python packages)       |
| Package Type        | Primarily pre-compiled Conda packages          | PyPI packages (wheels or source)       |
| Environment Mgmt  | Fully integrated with Conda                    | Installs into environment, but less integrated with Conda's tracking |

## 2. Managing Conda Environments After Deactivation

**Question:** How do I manage a Conda environment after deactivating it?

**Answer:**

You can use `conda` commands from another active environment (usually `base`) to manage deactivated environments:

*   `conda env list`: List all environments.
*   `conda activate <env_name>`: Activate an environment.
*   `conda env remove --name <env_name>`: Remove an environment.
*   `conda list --name <env_name>`: List packages in an environment.
*   `conda env export --name <env_name> > file.yml`: Export environment specification.

## 3. Replicating Conda Environments on Another PC

**Question:** How can I install the same environment with the same package versions on another PC?

**Answer:**

Use `conda env export` to create an `environment.yml` file and `conda env create -f environment.yml` on the target machine.

*   **Source PC:**
    ```bash
    conda activate <your_environment_name>
    conda env export --name <your_environment_name> > environment.yml
    ```
    (Use `--no-builds` for cross-platform compatibility, but with potential version differences).

*   **Target PC:**
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate <environment_name>
    ```
